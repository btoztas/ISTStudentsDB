Do you want to know what courses your colleges are taking?

This tool scrapes the HTML of every class page of a given course (in fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) to save to a database the informations about who participated in which class.

With this info, we can get the whole classes curriculum of a student, see what classes he repeated or even get a Ranking of the students that repeated more classes.
